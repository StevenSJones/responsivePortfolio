    <h1 class="mt-5">I was born in Boulder Colorado...</h1>
    <p class="lead">and currently live ten minutes east of Boulder in Broomfield. I've lived in Colorado for 28 of my 33 years. 
      I spend most of my time with my wife Moriah and sons; Ge'Ovonni and Steven, playing or watching ice hockey. We support the 
      Boston Bruins primarily because they gave us box seats while we were in Boston for our then five year old son Steven's 
      surgery. Steven got pneumonia and couldn't have the surgery. Then, through Boston Children's Hospital the Bruins organization 
      donated the tickets to us. We watched them lose to the Florida Panthers and were hooked. We came home and after some
      rest and recouperation, my sona started playing hockey and we never looked back. We also follow the Los Angeles Clippers
      in the NBA, the Oakland (soon to be Las Vegas) Raiders in the NFL and Liverpool in the Premier League. We are currently 
      in a state of flux and are hoping that I am able to pick up "this coding thing."</p>

      <p class="lead">I thouroughly enjoy listening to some smooth and slow jazz on just as slow Sunday afternoon, or anytime.
        I enjoy Chet Baker and John Coltrane very much. I also enjoy hip hop (I rapped and performed in a past life) as well as 
        R&B, metal and classical in the car. I enjoy comedy and right now am watching anything that I can find with Tom Sagura
        featured. I'd always slow the progression of channels for good boxing match. To me, the sweet science is just that. My
        wife and I bake often as well. My wife made me a lemon cake with raspberry filling and lemon cream cheese frosting and 
        my lemon cheesecake is... kind of big deal.
